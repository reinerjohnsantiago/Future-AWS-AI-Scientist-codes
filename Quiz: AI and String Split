In this exercise, you'll gain practical experience in analyzing text data, which is crucial for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Proper text analysis ensures that your models can process and understand the nuances of natural language effectively.

Text Analysis in NLP
Text analysis involves various tasks such as calculating the length of text, finding occurrences of specific words, and counting word frequencies. These skills are foundational for more advanced NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and text classification.

Tokenization and Sentiment Analysis
Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into individual words or tokens. It is a fundamental step in preprocessing text for NLP tasks.

Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. It is commonly used to analyze customer feedback, social media posts, and product reviews to gauge public opinion.

These exercises help you to:

Tokenize Text Data: Break down text into individual tokens.
Perform Sentiment Analysis: Use basic string methods to analyze the sentiment expressed in text.

model_output = "The AI model achieved an accuracy of 92.5% in the initial tests.\nThe model's performance was consistent across different datasets.\nFurther tuning of the model hyperparameters improved the accuracy to 94%.\nThis model is now ready for deployment in the production environment.\nModel performance will be monitored continuously to ensure it meets the expected standards."

print(model_output)

# Answer the questions
length_of_model_output = (len(model_output))
index_first_accuracy = model_output.find("92.5")
index_last_model = model_output.rfind("model")
count_model = model_output.count("model")

# Tokenize the model_output into individual words
tokens = model_output.split()

# Perform a basic sentiment analysis
positive_words = ['achieved', 'consistent', 'improved', 'ready', 'meets']
negative_words = ['monitored']

count_positive = sum(1 for word in positive_words if word in model_output)
count_negative = sum(1 for word in negative_words if word in model_output)

print("-"*50)
# Output your answers in descriptive messages
print("The length of the model output string is {} characters.".format(length_of_model_output))
print("The first occurrence of the word 'accuracy' is at index {}.".format(index_first_accuracy))
print("The last occurrence of the word 'model' is at index {}.".format(index_last_model))
print("The word 'model' occurs {} times in the model output.".format(count_model))
print("The tokenized model output is: {}".format(tokens))
print("The number of positive words is: {}".format(count_positive))
print("The number of negative words is: {}".format(count_negative))

result
The AI model achieved an accuracy of 92.5% in the initial tests.
The model's performance was consistent across different datasets.
Further tuning of the model hyperparameters improved the accuracy to 94%.
This model is now ready for deployment in the production environment.
Model performance will be monitored continuously to ensure it meets the expected standards.
--------------------------------------------------
The length of the model output string is 366 characters.
The first occurrence of the word 'accuracy' is at index 37.
The last occurrence of the word 'model' is at index 210.
The word 'model' occurs 4 times in the model output.
The tokenized model output is: ['The', 'AI', 'model', 'achieved', 'an', 'accuracy', 'of', '92.5%', 'in', 'the', 'initial', 'tests.', 'The', "model's", 'performance', 'was', 'consistent', 'across', 'different', 'datasets.', 'Further', 'tuning', 'of', 'the', 'model', 'hyperparameters', 'improved', 'the', 'accuracy', 'to', '94%.', 'This', 'model', 'is', 'now', 'ready', 'for', 'deployment', 'in', 'the', 'production', 'environment.', 'Model', 'performance', 'will', 'be', 'monitored', 'continuously', 'to', 'ensure', 'it', 'meets', 'the', 'expected', 'standards.']
The number of positive words is: 5
The number of negative words is: 1

About Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. It involves classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral based on the words and context. Sentiment analysis is commonly used to analyze customer feedback, social media posts, and product reviews to gauge public opinion and understand how people feel about a particular subject or entity.
