In this exercise, you'll work on creating a valid dictionary that maps AI model architectures to their respective research topics.
In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable types, such as strings or tuples. Lists, being mutable, cannot be used as dictionary keys.
This exercise will help you understand the importance of using appropriate data types for dictionary keys, which is crucial for handling data correctly in AI applications.
Quiz: Valid Dictionary for AI Model Architectures
In this exercise, you will correct an invalid dictionary that maps AI model researchers to their research topics.
In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable types, such as strings or tuples. Lists, being mutable, cannot be used as dictionary keys.

Here is the invalid dictionary provided:
# invalid dictionary - this should break
research_topics = {
    ['AlexNet', 'Convolutional Neural Network']: 'Image Classification',
    ['VGG', 'Visual Geometry Group']: 'Deep Learning',
    ['ResNet', 'Residual Networks']: 'Network Architecture'
}
#### CHANGE FROM [ TO ( BECAUSE [ ARE LIST AND IT IS MUTABLE AND CANNOT BE USED AS DICTIONARY KEYS
#### CHANGE FROM [ TO ( BECAUSE [ ARE LIST AND IT IS MUTABLE AND CANNOT BE USED AS DICTIONARY KEYS
#### CHANGE FROM [ TO ( BECAUSE [ ARE LIST AND IT IS MUTABLE AND CANNOT BE USED AS DICTIONARY KEYS

# corrected dictionary using tuples as keys 
research_topics = { 
    ('AlexNet', 'Convolutional Neural Network'): 'Image Classification', 
    ('VGG', 'Visual Geometry Group'): 'Deep Learning', 
    ('ResNet', 'Residual Networks'): 'Network Architecture' 
} 
# Verify the corrected dictionary 
print(research_topics) 

{('AlexNet', 'Convolutional Neural Network'): 'Image Classification', ('VGG', 'Visual Geometry Group'): 'Deep Learning', ('ResNet', 'Residual Networks'): 'Network Architecture'} 

Explanation: 
In the invalid dictionary, lists are used as keys, which causes an error because lists are mutable and cannot be used as dictionary keys. 
The corrected dictionary uses tuples instead of lists for the keys. Tuples are immutable and can be used as dictionary keys.
