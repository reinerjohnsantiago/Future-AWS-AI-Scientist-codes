Evaluating Model Performance
In this exercise, you will determine the performance of a machine learning model based on its accuracy. The accuracy of the model will be used to classify its performance into different categories.

Performance Categories:

0.0 - 0.5: Poor performance
0.51 - 0.75: Average performance
0.76 - 0.90: Good performance
0.91 - 1.0: Excellent performance
Problem Statement
Write an if statement that lets a data scientist know the performance category of their machine learning model based on the accuracy score, which is stored in the float variable accuracy.

Instructions:
Assign the result variable to a string holding the appropriate message based on the value of accuracy.
If the model's performance is classified as "Poor performance", the message should state "Model performance: Poor."
If the model's performance is classified as "Average performance", the message should state "Model performance: Average."
If the model's performance is classified as "Good performance", the message should state "Model performance: Good."
If the model's performance is classified as "Excellent performance", the message should state "Model performance: Excellent."
Example Input:
accuracy = 0.85  # use this input to make your submission

accuracy = 0.85  # use this input to make your submission

# write your if statement here #### ANSWERSS
if accuracy < 0.5:
    result = "Model performance: Poor."
elif accuracy < 0.75:
    result = "Model performance: Average."    
elif accuracy < 0.90:
    result = "Model performance: Good."
elif accuracy < 1.0:
    result = "Model performance: Excellent." 
else:   
    result = "Model performance: Perfect."       
    
# Check the result
print(result)

# Notebook grading
if result == "Model performance: Good.":
    print("Nice work!")
else:
    print("Not quite! Are your result strings formatted correctly?")


RESULTS
Model performance: Good.
Nice work!






THEIR SOLUTION


# Assign your accuracy score here
accuracy = 0.85

# Write your if statement here
if 0.0 <= accuracy <= 0.5:
    result = "Model performance: Poor."
elif 0.51 <= accuracy <= 0.75:
    result = "Model performance: Average."
elif 0.76 <= accuracy <= 0.90:
    result = "Model performance: Good."
elif 0.91 <= accuracy <= 1.0:
    result = "Model performance: Excellent."
else:
    result = "Invalid accuracy score."

# Check the result
print(result)

# Notebook grading
if result == "Model performance: Good.":
    print("Nice work!")
else:
    print("Not quite! Are your result strings formatted correctly?")
